This cURL command is the core API call that actually generates a video using Google's Veo 3 model. Unlike the previous requests that were interacting with the web application's own backend, this one calls a powerful, general-purpose Google Cloud API endpoint. It's the most complex and secure of the three.

Here‚Äôs the analysis:

## 2. ANALYSIS
---

### The Absolute Core of the Request üöÄ

These are the non-negotiable components. Without them, the request is dead on arrival.

- **`authorization: Bearer ya29.a0...`**: **This is the single most important header.** It completely replaces the cookie-based authentication from the previous examples. This is an **OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token**. Think of it as a temporary, high-security key üîë that the `labs.google` website gets from Google's authentication system on your behalf. It proves not only _who you are_ but also that you have granted the "Google Labs" application permission to perform this action. This token is short-lived and is the standard for modern, secure API communication.
    
- **`--data-raw '{...}'`**: This is the **payload**, containing the detailed instructions for the video generation. It tells the API everything it needs to know.
    
    - **`clientContext`**: Identifies the user's project (`projectId`), the tool being used (`"PINHOLE"` which is likely the internal name for Flow), and the user's subscription tier.
        
    - **`requests`**: An array allowing multiple videos to be generated in one call.
        
    - **`textInput`**: Contains the full, detailed prompt, including the main description, style guides, camera movements, audio instructions, and a negative prompt to exclude unwanted elements.
        
    - **`videoModelKey`: `"veo_3_0_t2v_fast"`**: This is the explicit instruction to use the **Veo 3 model** (specifically, the "fast" text-to-video version).
        

---

### Headers That Make You Look Human (and Legit) üé≠

These headers are crucial for passing the server's security checks and making the request look like it originated from a legitimate browser session on the `labs.google` website.

- **`origin: https://labs.google`**: Essential for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). It tells the `googleapis.com` server that the request is allowed because it's coming from the authorized `labs.google` domain.
    
- **`user-agent`**, **`sec-ch-ua-*`**, **`referer`**: These standard headers identify your browser and the page you were on, providing a consistent and believable client signature.
    
- **`sec-fetch-site: cross-site`**: This is a key detail. Unlike the previous `same-origin` requests, this one is correctly identified as `cross-site` because it's going from `labs.google` to a different domain (`googleapis.com`). This accuracy is important for passing modern browser security checks.
    

---

### Google's Special 'Secret Sauce' Headers üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

This request includes several custom `x-*` headers. These are likely part of a sophisticated anti-abuse and client-validation system.

- **`x-client-data`**: A Base64-encoded string that likely contains a wealth of client-side telemetry and identifying information.
    
- **`x-browser-validation`**: This looks like a cryptographic signature or hash. It's probably generated by JavaScript running on the page to create a unique "fingerprint" of the request, proving that it hasn't been tampered with and is coming from the genuine web application.
    

**These `x-*` headers are extremely important.** They are almost certainly generated dynamically. Simply copying and pasting them will likely fail after a short time or if any other part of the request changes. Automating a request like this is very difficult precisely because of these dynamic validation headers.

---

### Summary: The Anatomy of a Modern API Call

To make Google's AI sandbox generate a video for you, a request must have:

1. **A valid, unexpired `Authorization: Bearer` token.** This is your primary key.
    
2. **A correctly formatted JSON `payload`** detailing the exact video you want.
    
3. **A full suite of browser-mimicking headers** (`user-agent`, `origin`, etc.) that are internally consistent (e.g., `sec-fetch-site: cross-site`).
    
4. **Proprietary validation headers (`x-client-data`, `x-browser-validation`)** that are dynamically generated by the client-side application.
    

In essence, this request shows a shift from a simple website session (using cookies) to a formal, secure application-to-API transaction (using an OAuth token and client-side validation).

## 3. REQUIREMENTS
### SEED Number Must random 

The `seed` in Veo 3 works just like a world seed in the game Minecraft.

- Entering a specific seed number will always generate the exact same world, with the same mountains, rivers, and caves in the same locations.
    
- Entering a different seed number will create a completely new, unique world.
    

So, the **`seed`** is your key to controlling the creative randomness of the AI. Use it to either lock in a result you love or explore infinite variations of your idea. üîë

The maximum seed is typically **2,147,483,647**.

### SCENE ID CREATE BY CLIENT 

2a483b8f-f771-47d3-bb04-e45d5d951d7a

That format is a **Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)**, specifically a **Version 4 UUID**.

It's a standard 128-bit number represented as a 32-character hexadecimal string, broken into five groups with the pattern `8-4-4-4-12`. Version 4 UUIDs are generated from random numbers, making them ideal for client-side creation as they don't require a central authority to avoid collisions.

### AUTHORIZATION KEY GET BY CALLING GET AND PROCESS HTML

The Bearer token to add to this call is by using the cookie and making request to the page https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow
Then do the search for it in the script tag like this:


```json
<script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">
