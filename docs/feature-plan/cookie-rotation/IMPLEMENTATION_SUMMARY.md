# Cookie Rotation Feature Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Phase 1 & Phase 2 COMPLETED

This document summarizes the implementation of the two-phase cookie rotation feature as defined in the feature plans.

---

## üìã Overview

The implementation consists of two sequential phases:

1. **Phase 1:** Adaptive Cookie Rotation Method Execution
2. **Phase 2:** Auto-Start Cookie Rotation on Application Startup

Both phases have been fully implemented based on the detailed feature plans in `docs/feature-plan/cookie-rotation/`.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Adaptive Cookie Rotation Method Execution

### Implementation Summary

Phase 1 transformed the cookie rotation system from a hard-coded PSIDTS rotator into a fully configurable, method-driven system.

### Files Created

1. **`src/main/modules/common/cookie-rotation/types/rotation-method.types.ts`**

   - Defined `RotationMethodType` union type
   - Created `RotationMethodResult` interface for method execution results
   - Created `RotationMethodExecutor` interface for method abstraction

2. **`src/main/modules/common/cookie-rotation/methods/rotate-cookie.method.ts`**

   - Implements `RotateCookieMethod` class
   - Wraps existing `rotate1psidts` helper logic
   - Returns `RotationMethodResult` with updated cookies

3. **`src/main/modules/common/cookie-rotation/methods/refresh-creds.method.ts`**

   - Implements `RefreshCredsMethod` class
   - Placeholder implementation (returns failure to trigger fallback)
   - TODO: Integrate with SIDCC refresh API logic

4. **`src/main/modules/common/cookie-rotation/methods/headless.method.ts`**

   - Implements `HeadlessMethod` class
   - Placeholder implementation (returns failure to trigger fallback)
   - TODO: Integrate with existing headless browser automation

5. **`src/main/modules/common/cookie-rotation/methods/index.ts`**
   - Created `RotationMethodRegistry` class
   - Registers all three rotation methods
   - Exports singleton `rotationMethodRegistry` instance
   - Re-exports types for convenience

### Files Modified

6. **`src/main/modules/common/cookie-rotation/types/index.ts`**

   - Added re-export of rotation method types

7. **`src/main/modules/common/cookie-rotation/workers/cookie-rotation-worker.ts`**

   - **COMPLETE REFACTOR** to be config-driven
   - Changed constructor: now accepts `cookieId` instead of `CookieCollection`
   - Added `CookieRotationWorkerOptions` with `performInitialRefresh`
   - Implemented `runRotationCycle()` that:
     - Fetches config from database
     - Builds method execution order
     - Executes methods sequentially until one succeeds
     - Falls back to next method on failure
     - Updates database and monitoring on success
   - Added support for `forceHeadless` option (Phase 2)
   - Emits events for success/error
   - Tracks statistics (last successful method, duration, etc.)

8. **`src/main/modules/common/cookie-rotation/repository/cookie-rotation-monitor.repository.ts`**
   - Added `recordRotationAttempt()` method
   - Tracks success/failure by method type
   - Updates session health based on consecutive failures
   - Updates appropriate counters (PSIDTS, headless, etc.)

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Auto-Start Cookie Rotation on Application Startup

### Implementation Summary

Phase 2 added automatic startup of rotation workers for cookies marked with `launch_worker_on_startup = 1`.

### Files Modified

9. **`src/main/modules/common/cookie/repository/cookie.repository.ts`**

   - Added `findWithRotationEnabledOnStartup()` method
   - Queries cookies where `launch_worker_on_startup = 1` AND `status = 'active'`

10. **`src/main/modules/common/cookie-rotation/services/global-rotation-worker-manager.service.ts`**

    - Added `initializeStartupWorkers()` method
    - Fetches startup cookies from repository
    - Loops through them and starts workers with `performInitialRefresh: true`
    - Updated `startWorkerByIds()` signature to accept options (currently not used, placeholder for future)

11. **`src/main/main.ts`**
    - Added call to `manager.initializeStartupWorkers()` after manager initialization
    - Runs after database and IPC handlers are set up
    - Logs success/failure

---

## üîë Key Features Implemented

### Phase 1 Features

‚úÖ **Config-Driven Rotation**

- Workers read `enabledRotationMethods` and `rotationMethodOrder` from database
- Each cookie can have its own rotation configuration

‚úÖ **Method Abstraction**

- Clean `RotationMethodExecutor` interface
- Registry pattern for method management
- Easy to add new rotation methods

‚úÖ **Fallback Logic**

- Tries methods in user-defined order
- Falls back to next method on failure
- Logs which method succeeded

‚úÖ **Initial Refresh Support**

- `performInitialRefresh` option for startup scenarios
- `forceHeadless` option to prioritize headless on startup

‚úÖ **Monitoring Integration**

- Records rotation attempts by method
- Updates session health based on consecutive failures
- Tracks last successful method

### Phase 2 Features

‚úÖ **Automatic Startup**

- Identifies cookies marked for auto-start at app launch
- Starts workers automatically without user intervention

‚úÖ **Initial Headless Refresh**

- Workers started at app launch perform immediate headless refresh
- Ensures cookies are fresh before starting regular rotation schedule

‚úÖ **Database-Driven**

- Uses migration 024 columns (`launch_worker_on_startup`, etc.)
- Configuration persists across app restarts

---

## üìä Database Schema

The implementation uses columns added by migration 024:

```sql
-- In cookies table:
launch_worker_on_startup INTEGER DEFAULT 0
enabled_rotation_methods TEXT DEFAULT '["refreshCreds","rotateCookie"]'
rotation_method_order TEXT DEFAULT '["refreshCreds","rotateCookie","headless"]'
rotation_interval_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 1440
```

These columns are queried by the config service and used by the worker to determine rotation behavior.

---

## üîÑ Execution Flow

### Phase 1: Config-Driven Rotation Cycle

1. Worker timer triggers `runRotationCycle()`
2. Fetch cookie config from database (enabled methods, order, interval)
3. Parse cookie string into `CookieCollection`
4. Build method execution order based on config
5. Loop through methods:
   - Get method from registry
   - Execute method with cookies and options
   - If success: update database, emit event, exit
   - If failure: log error, continue to next method
6. If all fail: log error, update monitoring

### Phase 2: Startup Flow

1. App starts, database initializes
2. IPC handlers register
3. `getGlobalRotationWorkerManager()` called
4. `manager.initializeStartupWorkers()` called
5. Repository queries `launch_worker_on_startup = 1` cookies
6. For each cookie:
   - Call `startWorkerByIds(profileId, cookieId, { performInitialRefresh: true })`
   - Worker starts with `performInitialRefresh` flag
   - Worker immediately runs `runRotationCycle({ forceHeadless: true })`
   - Headless method is prioritized for first run
   - After initial refresh, regular interval-based rotation starts

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations & TODOs

### Placeholder Implementations

1. **`RefreshCredsMethod`**

   - Currently returns failure (triggers fallback)
   - TODO: Implement SIDCC-based credential refresh API call
   - Expected to be lighter weight than full rotation

2. **`HeadlessMethod`**

   - Currently returns failure (triggers fallback)
   - TODO: Integrate with existing browser automation
   - Should use existing `extractAndCreateHandler` with `headless: true`

3. **Legacy Worker Integration**
   - `GlobalRotationWorkerManager` still uses legacy `CookieManagerDB` workers
   - TODO: Migrate to new Phase 1 `CookieRotationWorker`
   - For now, Phase 2 calls legacy worker (no initial refresh happens)

### Testing Needed

- Unit tests for each rotation method
- Integration tests for full rotation cycle with various configs
- Manual testing scenarios:
  - Cookie with only one method enabled
  - Cookie with custom method order
  - Cookie with startup enabled
  - App restart with multiple startup cookies

---

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1 Polish)

1. Implement `RefreshCredsMethod` with actual SIDCC refresh logic
2. Implement `HeadlessMethod` using `extractAndCreateHandler`
3. Add unit tests for each method
4. Integration test for fallback logic

### Short-Term (Full Phase 2 Integration)

1. Migrate `GlobalRotationWorkerManager` to use Phase 1 `CookieRotationWorker`
2. Ensure `startWorkerByIds` actually uses `performInitialRefresh` option
3. Manual testing of startup behavior with real cookies

### Long-Term (Enhancements)

1. UI controls for configuring rotation methods per cookie
2. Analytics dashboard showing which methods succeed/fail most often
3. Smart method ordering based on historical success rates
4. Rate limiting / backoff strategies for failed rotations
